1) Information of next state is maintained in StopWatch only. 
   In my solution, ConcreteState used to set the next state of StopWatch.
   By moving the responsibility of setting next state to StopWatch, we eliminated two things:
       1) Static methods to create ConcreteStates.
       2) Extra method in StopWatch to setState from ConcreteState.
        
2) Usage of exceptions to handle invalid states. Invalid states should throw "InvalidStateException".

TODO: Implement using exceptions.
